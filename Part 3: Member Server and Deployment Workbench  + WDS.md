# Setting Up A Member Server

In my lab environment, I want to create my own Windows image using both Deployment Workbench and Windows Deployment Services (WDS). This image will be used to install a standardized Windows on regular workstation nodes and will automatically add those nodes to the domain during the iamging process. As such, I will be using Deployment Workbench and WDS on a 
member server to further isolate my domain controller. This way, in the event that something happens to my member server(s), this isolation should minimize effects to my domain controller.
